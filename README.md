## File Processing
1000 files of size 2-5 MB are created. All files are converted to upper case, time taken to process first 200, 400, 800 and 1000 files is noted and graph is ploted showing the number of files processed vs time. Then the same task is done by using multithreading. Time taken using 1, 2, 3....10 threads is noted and a graph is plotted. From the graph, we can find the number of threads that take minimum time. At last, a graph is plotted comparing the time taken when mutithreading is used vs when multithreading is not used. The graph will make it clear that with the help of multithreading, we can decrease the processing time.

## Image Processing
This project is similar to file processing but here 591 images are taken. All images are converted to grayscale, time taken to process first 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 591 images is noted and graph is ploted showing the number of images processed vs time. Then the same task is done by using multithreading. Time taken using 1, 2, 3....10 threads is noted and a graph is plotted. From the graph, we can find the number of threads that take minimum time. At last, a graph is plotted comparing the time taken when mutithreading is used vs when multithreading is not used. The graph will make it clear that with the help of multithreading, we can decrease the processing time.
